TacoTime is an app to help you find tacos. With just one button, TacoTime finds your location, then finds restaurants around you that serve tacos that are currently open. It then provides directions.

## History
TacoTime was originally the final project for a group graduating from Codecademy Labs in April of 2015. The group included:
- Melissa Roadman
- Dovie Gelerinter
- Jamie [redacted]
- Jon Samp

After about a year of learning, I decided to take another look at the app, and re-design and re-factor it to work more reliably, since friends and colleagues of mine are still using it from time to time.

The current release was released in March of 2016, and is what I like to call TacoTime 2.0.
